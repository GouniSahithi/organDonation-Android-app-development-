# organDonation-Android-app-development-
Our project is mainly focused on providing services to the needy through a single application and making the donation process easy. In this donation, the donor can easily reach the needy through the consent of the admin. In the other kinds of donations, it mainly collects the donations of the donors and delivers them to the respective organizations and provides the information to the respective doctors of that organization to maintain transparency. To manage donor registration and user maintenance. People who are interested can register themselves through this system. The proposed system is a decentralized app for organ donation using blockchain technology. It would be a web application for patients to register their information importantly medical ID, blood type, organ type, and state. The system would work on a first-in, first-out basis unless a patient is in critical condition. Organ donation is the process of giving an organ or tissue to help someone in need of a transplant. It plays a crucial role in saving lives, as it provides individuals suffering from organ failure the opportunity to receive a functional organ and continue living. Organs can be donated either from living individuals or those who have passed away. The most commonly donated organs include the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, and pancreas. Despite its life-saving potential, organ donation faces challenges such as a shortage of donors, ethical concerns, and the need for greater public awareness. Promoting education about organ donation and encouraging people to register as donors can help address these challenges, ultimately improving the chances of survival for those in urgent need of a transplant.
